# Backend-Dev-Fundamentals

Explore the fundamentals of Backend Development using JavaScript, NodeJS and ExpressJS.

## Types of Web Development

1. Front End Development
2. Back End Development
3. Full Stack Development

## Front-End Development

- Front End refers to what you actually see on the website in a browser.
- It is also referred as Client Side Development.
- Front End developers are responsible for everything that you see when you’re navigating around the Internet.

## Back-End Development

- Back End refers to what actually happens under the hood on the web servers.
- It is also referred as Server Side Development.
- Back End developers are responsible for the architecture, databases, database transactions and much more.

## Full-Stack Development

- Full Stack development is the combination of Front End and Back End development.
- Full Stack developers can be referred as jacks-of-all-trades such as MERN, MEAN and MEVN stack developers.

## Client Server Architecture

- It is a network architecture in which clients request though a browser and receive resources from a web server.
- The browser then renders the web pages using DOM interpreter, CSS interpreter and JS Engine.

## HTTP Request Methods

| Method | Operation      |
| ------ | -------------- |
| GET    | Read           |
| POST   | Create         |
| PUT    | Update/Replace |
| DELETE | Delete         |

## HTTP Status Code

- 1XX: Informational
- 2XX: Success
- 3XX: Redirection
- 4XX: Client Error
- 5XX: Server Error

## What is API?

- Stands for Application Programming Interface
- Connection between different computer programs
- Allows two different applications to talk to each other

## What is JSON?

- Stands for JavaScript Object Notation
- It is a lightweight data-interchange format
- It is plain text written in JavaScript object notation
- It is used to send data between computers
- It is language independent

## What is JavaScript?

- High level, interpreted programming language
- Runs on Browser as well as on Server
- Conforms to ECMAScript specification
- Multi-paradigm, Single threaded
- Supports Object oriented and Functional Programming style

## Why should we use JavaaScript?

- Programming language of the browser
- Build interactive UI using JS frameworks like React, Vue and Angular
- Builds very fast Server side and Full Stack applications
- Can also be used in Mobile development using React Native, Ionic
- Can also be used in Desktop App development using Electron JS

## What is Node.js?

- Open-source, cross-platform, back-end - JavaScript runtime environment
- Fast, efficient and highly scalable
- Runs on the V8 JavaScript engine developed by Google
- Allows us to run JavaScript code on the server
- Event driven, non-blocking I/O model
- Javascript Everywhere on the front-end and back-end

## What is NPM?

- NPM stands for Node Package Manager
- Install 3rd party packages such as frameworks, libraries and tools
- Packages are stored in the node_modules folder
- All dependencies are listed in package.json file
- NPM scripts are used to run different tasks

## What is ExpressJS?

- Fast, Flexible and Minimalistic Web application framework
- Makes building web application with Node.js much easier
- Extremely light, fast, open-source and most popular
- Used for both server rendered apps as well as API
- Full control of request and response
- Great to use with client side frameworks as it’s all JavaScript

## Route Handling - ExpressJS

- Handling requests and routes is very fast and simple
- Simple syntax - app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), app.delete() and so on
- Render a HTML template, send JSON/file, redirect URL and much more
- Use any database like MongoDB, PostgreSQL and so on
- Access URL params, Query strings, Base URL and more
- We can store routes in separate files and export using Express Router

## What is REST API?

- REST stands for Representational State Transfer
- It is a set of architectural constraints
- It transfers representation of the state of a resource to the requester
- General formats: JSON, HTML, plain text and more
- Mostly used for Internet of Things (IoT), Mobile - Development and Web Development
